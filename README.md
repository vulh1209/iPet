## Installation

### Download (Recommended)

1. Download the latest DMG from [Releases](../../releases):
   - `iPet_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg` - Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
   - `iPet_x.x.x_x64.dmg` - Intel Mac
2. Open the DMG and drag **iPet** to your **Applications** folder
3. **Important**: Run this command in Terminal to allow the app:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/iPet.app
   ```
4. Open iPet from Applications
5. Grant microphone permission when prompted (for voice chat)

> **Why?** The app is not notarized (no $99 Apple Developer fee), so macOS blocks it by default.

### Mood System

Your pet has 2 core stats:
- **😊 Happiness (0-100)**: Joy level - decays over time
- **⚡ Energy (0-100)**: Stamina - decreases with activities, recovers while sleeping

**Pet Behavior & Animations:**
| Happiness | Energy | Idle Animation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 80+ | any | Ecstatic (sparkles) |
| 60-79 | any | Happy (smiling) |
| 40-59 | any | Normal |
| < 40 | any | Sad |
| any | < 20 | Angry (exhausted) |
| any | auto-sleep | Yawn → Sleep → Wake |

### Voice Chat

1. Press `V` to start recording
2. Say your question or greeting to pet
3. Wait for pet to respond with a cute speech bubble
4. Pet replies in short kawaii style (3 words + emoji)

**Note:** Configure your Gemini API key in Settings before using voice chat.

### Cooldown & Rejection

- Each interaction has its own cooldown (see table above)
- When on cooldown or low energy → shows ❌ icon and pet shakes head
- Hover over pet to see current Happiness/Energy bars

### Balance Philosophy

The interaction system is designed with these principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Diversify** | Use multiple interaction types, not just spam one |
| ⚖️ **Risk-Reward** | Fun activities (dance, play) cost energy → need rest/treat balance |
| 🧘 **Patience Pays** | Quiet time gives good rewards for letting pet rest |
| 🚫 **Gentle Care** | Dragging pet too much hurts their mood significantly |

**Energy Levels:**
| Level | Range | Pet Behavior |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Hyperactive | 75-100 | Full of energy, ready for anything! |
| Energetic | 55-74 | Happy and playful |
| Normal | 30-54 | Content, may need a snack |
| Tired | 10-29 | Sluggish, prefers rest |
| Exhausted | 0-9 | Forced sleep triggered |

### Tips & Tricks

| Tip | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| 🌙 Auto Sleep | Pet auto-sleeps when energy < 10 - give treats for quick recovery |
| 🎵 Lullaby | Use when pet is too hyper, helps them rest |
| 🧘 Quiet Time | Best way to restore energy without losing happiness |
| 💬 Voice Chat | Talk frequently to keep your pet happy! |
| 🎯 Combo | Dance → Quiet Time → Treat to maximize both stats |
| ⚠️ Don't Spam | Each interaction has diminishing returns if overused |
